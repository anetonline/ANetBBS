# ANetBBS v1.0a2.215 — BinkP service + AKA admin move (June 2026)

BinkP inbound listener now has its own systemd service (`anetbbs-binkp`) and appears
in the Service Control Center alongside all other services. FTN AKA management moved
from the profile dropdown to Admin → Echomail.

# ANetBBS v1.0a2.214 — HACKERS theme easter egg: Hack the Planet modal (July 2026)

The "HACK THE PLANET" text in the navbar (HACKERS theme only) is now a secret clickable
link. Clicking it opens a tribute modal: crew roster with rainbow-animated handles
(Zero Cool · Acid Burn · Crash Override · Cereal Killer · Lord Nikon · Phantom Phreak ·
The Plague), iconic quotes, a heartfelt BBS tribute paragraph, and a typewriter terminal
that types "HACK THE PLANET" then "ACCESS GRANTED". Closes with [ LATER, HACKER ].

# ANetBBS v1.0a2.213 — Two epic themes: VOID SIGNAL + HACKERS (1995) (July 2026)

Two new built-in themes, both wildly different from the standard color-swap options.
Select either in **Profile → Themes** (auto-seeded on startup, nothing to configure).

**VOID SIGNAL ◈**: Triple neon — electric green + cyan + magenta on pure black.
Full-page CRT scanlines, moving phosphor beam sweep, brand glitch animation,
cycling 3-color card border stripe, neon glow buttons, custom green scrollbar.

**HACKERS (1995) ◈**: For those who ride the information superhighway.
Neon violet + lime + cyan on black with rainbow cycling navbar border, 6-stage
rainbow brand glitch, animated multicolor card top stripe, rainbow footer sweep,
and a "HACK THE PLANET" watermark in the navbar. Hack the planet.

# ANetBBS v1.0a2.212 — Fix casino wallet saves; fix stale door game sessions (July 2026)

- **Casino wallet CSRF fix**: wallet balance now saves correctly after each hand/spin.
  The `_csrf()` helper in all 4 casino templates was reading from a cookie that doesn't
  exist — token is in `<meta name="csrf-token">`. Every wallet POST was silently rejected.
- **Door game sessions**: WebSocket disconnect now terminates the game session.
  A socket→session map is maintained so `game_disconnect` can call `terminate_session`.
- **Startup session cleanup**: any sessions still marked `active` from before a server
  restart are marked `stale` on startup (PTY state is gone after restart anyway).
- **Admin → Game Sessions**: "Terminate All" button bulk-clears all active sessions at once.

# ANetBBS v1.0a2.211 — Web casino games: persistent wallet + weekly reset + leaderboard (July 2026)

Blackjack, Slots, Video Poker, and Hold'em now remember your balance between sessions.
Balance resets every Monday to the configured starting amount. If you hit zero, play
is locked until the weekly reset. Peak balance is tracked on the leaderboard.
Starting amounts are configurable per-game in Admin → Settings (`CASINO_*_START` keys).

# ANetBBS v1.0a2.210 — Fix upgrade checker error when REGISTRY_URL is not configured (July 2026)

Admin → Upgrades no longer shows a `MissingSchema` error when `REGISTRY_URL` is not set.

---

# ANetBBS v1.0a2.209 — Menu admin: add imsg / imsg_send / rss to action-type dropdown (July 2026)

---

# ANetBBS v1.0a2.207 — Terminal MRC fixes; QWK blank-body diagnostic (July 2026)

**Terminal MRC chat (`/mrc`):**

- `/afk [msg]` now sends the correct `AFK` command (was `STATUS AFK`), so the
  away message set with `/afk BRB` is now visible to other chatters
- `/back` now sends `BACK` instead of `STATUS AFK`
- Fixed "Rate limit: please slow down" error when sending the first message
  after returning from AFK — the client no longer fires an extra `STATUS AFK`
  packet immediately before the chat message
- Tab-complete now tracks users who join after you: `USERIN:`, `USEROUT:`,
  `USERLIST:`, and `USERNICK:` packets are parsed to keep the nick pool current
  instead of being silently dropped. The `from_user` field (what the bridge
  actually sends) is also used for nick tracking on chat messages.
- `/chatters` now sends `CHATTERS` (all rooms); `/who` and `/whoon` send
  `WHOON` (current room only). Previously both sent `WHOON`.
- Help text updated to reflect the `/who` vs `/chatters` distinction.

**QWK inbound:**

- Added `WARNING` log line when an inbound Dove-Net message arrives with a
  blank body. Logs the first 256 raw bytes so we can tell whether the hub is
  sending empty blocks or whether `_clean_body` is over-stripping.

**Admin UI:**

- QWK password field now has `autocomplete="new-password"` to prevent browsers
  from auto-filling it with the admin login password.

# ANetBBS v1.0a2.206 — Fix dosemu2 conf written to /tmp (July 2026)

dosemu2 temp files (conf + COM1 PTS path) were hardcoded to `/tmp/`. Servers
with a restricted `/tmp/` (noexec or tightened permissions) failed to launch
any dosemu door with "Permission denied". Files now written to
`<DATA_DIR>/temp/` via the existing `temp_root()` helper, which the anetbbs
service user always has write access to.

---

# ANetBBS v1.0a2.205 — Fix menu hotkey duplication on update (July 2026)

Menu seeder now checks by action type instead of hotkey when backfilling new
items on existing installs. Sysops who rebound default hotkeys no longer get
duplicate menu entries added back on every service restart or update.

---

# ANetBBS v1.0a2.204 — Remove ANetCRAFT Enhanced and RDQ3 from release (July 2026)

- Removed ANetCRAFT Enhanced web game (template + WEB_GAMES entry)
- Removed Red Dragon Quest 3 door (doors/mystic/rdq3/)

---

# ANetBBS v1.0a2.203 — Beta release: package cleanup, REGISTRY_URL fix, docs update (July 2026)

Pre-release cleanup for the v1.0 Beta on July 1, 2026.

- Fixed `REGISTRY_URL` default from hardcoded hub to empty string — sysops must now opt in to federation by setting `REGISTRY_URL` in Admin → Settings
- `mrc/bridge/config.example.json`: changed `bridge_bbs` from hardcoded BBS name to generic placeholder
- CHANGELOG: removed internal tooling reference from v1.0a2.200 entry
- README: updated status from alpha 2 to beta; removed broken FEATURES.md link

---

# ANetBBS v1.0a2.202 — Security: auto-ban, IP whitelist, GeoIP country blocking, wiki edit gate (June 2026)

Auto-ban permanently blocks IPs that trip the login rate limiter (10 attempts / 5 min).
IP whitelist bypasses all ban and country checks. Country blocking via ip-api.com (free,
no registration — just set BLOCKED_COUNTRIES=CN,RU,... in Admin Settings). Wiki edit gate
requires 5 posts + 3-day account (configurable). fail2ban configs in deploy/fail2ban/.

# ANetBBS v1.0a2.201 — Theme edit/delete + MSP toggle in Admin Settings (June 2026)

Theme management is now fully self-service from the admin UI:

- **Theme edit**: Edit button was wired to the route but missing from the theme_builder listing.
  Now shows in both Admin → Themes and the Theme Builder's existing-themes table.
- **Theme delete**: New `DELETE /admin/themes/<id>/delete` route. Refuses to delete the
  active default theme (the button is disabled with a tooltip). Users who had the deleted theme
  selected fall back gracefully (their `theme_id` is nulled → system default applies).
  Confirm dialog in browser prevents accidental deletion.
- **MSP enable/disable**: `MSP_ENABLED` and `MSP_PORT` added to Admin → Settings
  EDITABLE_SETTINGS list. Sysops can now toggle MSP on/off and change the port from the UI
  without editing `.env` by hand. Requires service restart (flagged in the UI).

# ANetBBS v1.0a2.200 — QWK outbound: remove diagnostic logging

Remove verbose REP diagnostics added in v1.0a2.198 (body hex dump, /tmp REP copy).
The bugs they targeted are fixed; production logging is restored to concise INFO lines.

# ANetBBS v1.0a2.199 — QWK outbound: fix \r in body + MSGID space truncation

Fix two bugs in `_build_rep_packet` confirmed by hex-dumping `/tmp/anetbbs_last.rep`:

1. Body encoding left `\r` bytes from Windows `\r\n` line endings. The replacement
   only converted `\n` → `\xe3`, leaving `\r\xe3` throughout the body instead of
   bare `\xe3`. Fixed: replace `\r\n` first, then lone `\r`, then `\n`.

2. Auto-generated MSGID contained a space: `ANETBBS_<hash> <timestamp>`. Synchronet's
   `qwk_import_msg` calls `truncstr(p, " ")` on the MSGID value, storing only
   `ANETBBS_<hash>` — discarding the timestamp. That truncated form is identical on
   every re-upload of the same message, triggering dupe detection and silently dropping
   the message. Fixed: use underscore separator so the full string is stored.

# ANetBBS v1.0a2.198 — QWK diagnostics: REP saved to /tmp, body hex dump

Add two diagnostics to pinpoint why outbound QWK messages don't appear on Dove-Net:
- Save every REP packet to `/tmp/anetbbs_last.rep` for local inspection
- Log first 64 bytes of body hex in REP header dump

# ANetBBS v1.0a2.196 — QWK outbound: uppercase MSG filename + space padding

Fix outbound QWK (Dove-Net) messages not appearing on the hub. Two bugs in `_build_rep_packet`:

1. Inner ZIP filename was `VERT.msg` (lowercase extension). Synchronet's `pack_rep.cpp` creates `VERT.MSG` (uppercase). The `extract_files_from_archive` call in `un_rep.cpp` filters filenames through `SAFEST_FILENAME_CHARS`; on any configuration that excludes lowercase letters, extraction breaks entirely (the code uses `break`, not `continue`), the MSG file is never extracted, and the hub silently rejects the REP with "MSG file not received".

2. Body block padding used null bytes (`\x00`) instead of spaces (`0x20`). Synchronet pads with spaces; null bytes are skipped in the QWK body parser loop but non-standard.
